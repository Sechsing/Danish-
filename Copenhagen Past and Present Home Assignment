Introduction

	There are two significant shifts in power in Danish history, notably the shift of the power from the nobility and clergy to the monarch and the later shift of power from the monarch to the people. The first process occurs gradually from the creation of Danish state until the end of the age of absolute monarchy. Absolute rule in Denmark persisted from 1660 until the advent of constitutional monarchy with the enactment of the constitution in 1849 (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). The year 1814 during the period of absolute monarchy was a pivotal year marked by the surrender of Norway as part of the Treaty of Kiel. This event signaled the demise of the dual monarchy of Denmark-Norway and symbolized the end of Denmark's status as a Nordic great power. The year 1814 also brought Denmark to the brink of economic collapse due to its involvement in the Napoleonic Wars from 1807 to 1814. This economic strain, coupled with the loss of Norway and mounting challenges to absolute rule, marked a significant turning point in Denmark's history. Not long after the Napoleonic Wars, the second process begin and power transferred from the monarch to the people as the events of 1814 set the stage for the eventual transition to constitutional monarchy and the broader political transformations that followed, this occurs from 1849 when Denmark gained a free constitution to 1864 and later, when Denmark’s politics were starting to be characterized by the emergence of political parties of the left and right, replacing the traditional monarchy to rule over internal and external affairs of Denmark (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). From there, Denmark’s royal family still remained, but largely as figureheads with no real exercise over political power. However, they still retain large influences domestically and internationally. For example, the monarch or the royal family using a certain product act as great advertisements to the public in Denmark and other countries to an extent.

The first shift in power happened due to a variety of reasons. The first and foremost is naturally the ruling monarchs’ desire to gain power for him or herself. In the early Danish monarchy system, there are three major groups of power that decided affairs in Denmark: the monarch, the clergy and the nobility (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). The clergy held religious power and possessed massive amounts of assets as the churches attracted masses along with their funds. The nobility held important positions and had their personal armies under the feudal contract. Over time, the monarchs of Denmark reduced the power of both and inserted loyal stewards that occupied their position with the end result of an absolute monarchy being installed. This development was equally evident in other European countries as a consequence of power struggles between the three. However, the success of the installation of an absolute monarchy was not just a matter of the monarch’s ambitions being put in action, the reason lies equally in other factors such as the population, the military and the political and religious landscape of Denmark (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Around the late 1510s, the reform movement that was spearheaded by Martin Luther was starting to bore fruit, this brought significant changes to the churches and the religious system over most of Europe. Naturally this movement impacted Denmark too and it reduced the influence of the church that existed traditionally. Similarly to the reformation, the plagues that ravaged Europe in the Middle Ages had profound impacts on the Danish society, particularly it damaged small landowners that was the financial base of the clergy and the nobles by wiping out the population that was required to farm the lands. Even though the monarch had also suffered because of the pandemics, he or she could still financially recover with the incomes from tariffs and trade. Militarily, a series of advancements beginning from the 1400s was undermining the strength of heavy cavalry on the battlefield that was largely supplied by the nobility. Thus, the monarch was less reliant on them militarily and politically. All these changes paved way to the eventual proclamation of an absolute monarchy by Frederick III in 1660, the most pivotal event after the Swedish invasion of Denmark, which arguably contributed to it. From then on, all affairs of Denmark-Norway was dictated by the monarch alone and the group of clergy and nobility had their influences largely diminished. The absolutist rule proved to have an everlasting impact on Copenhagen, Denmark and traditional territories of Denmark namely Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Schleswig and Holstein. As a direct result, the Kings and Queens after 1660 held total power and steered the country in whichever directions that their ambitions lead. However, this does not mean the monarch controlled all aspects of Denmark at all times, particularly during the reign of Christian VII, a German physician named Struensee was able to govern as the de facto regent of Denmark due to the mental state of Christian VII that was abnormal (Langen & Stjernfelt, 2022). In the aftermath of absolute monarchy being in place, changes took place in the form of centralization of law and standards. As evident, with the centralization of power comes centralization of various forms that met the traditional Danish society with force. Other than new laws and standards, a more visual and physical change was the grand buildings that are built following the order of the absolute monarchs. Moreover, the most exhilarating change came in the form of total freedom of the press when Struensee briefly controlled the affairs of Denmark. The period of press freedom was however short-lived, as it was cut short when he was executed by the dowager queen. In spite of this, the impact on the Danish society remains because the restrictions for the press that existed before was never really reinstated by the successive government. 

Similarly, the second shift in power during the 19th century was driven by a confluence of factors. Influenced by the aftermath of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, national movements emerged advocating for political reforms and greater representation (Jesperson, 2018). This sentiment coupled with internal pressures and external events such as the loss of Norway to Sweden in 1814 and the Treaty of Kiel, laid the groundwork for Denmark's transition from absolutism to constitutional monarchy. The rise of liberal and nationalist movements that were particularly evident in Copenhagen demanded expanded political rights and the establishment of democratic institutions. The introduction of advisory assemblies and the drafting of new constitutions reflected these demands, leading to the formalization of limited suffrage and the formation of political parties like Venstre and Højre (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Denmark's internal struggles, including the Three Years’ War and the First Schleswig War, underlined the complexities of its transition. The conflict between Danish National Liberals and Schleswig-Holstein's movement highlighted competing visions of national identity and governance, while external interventions by Prussia and Austria further complicated the situation. In the midst of all the complications, Frederick VII, the last absolute monarch soon yielded to the demands of Danish citizens and resorted to abolish the absolute monarchy. The kingdom of Denmark was then governed in the fashion of constitutional monarchy that would grew to usher in an era of politics dominated by political parties instead of a single monarch. Naturally, this transformation opened the path to the shifts that occur in both domestic and foreign policies (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Domestically, some of the special rights traditionally enjoyed by guilds and merchants were removed and a liberal approach to the economy was adopted by the government. On the international side of things, Denmark’s foreign policy changed as the political party, Venstre chose to apply a more diplomatic approach after the disastrous wars with the newly formed Germany.

Despite the number of challenges, Denmark's journey towards constitutional governance and democratic principles prevailed through the two aforementioned shifts in power. The establishment of a parliament, social legislation, and a focus on education and infrastructure marked significant milestones in Denmark's political evolution and impacted the people of Copenhagen in more than one ways. The transition from absolutism to constitutional monarchy not only reshaped Denmark's political landscape but also influenced its societal fabric and international relations. In the process, Copenhagen played its role as a hub of political activity, driving forward the trajectory of Danish governance towards greater inclusivity and representation for the people living in its land. Through resilience and adaptation, Denmark navigated through turbulent times that shaped its identity as a modern democratic nation. Copenhagen and its inhabitants contributed immensely in this period of history and had always been the foremost front to experience the changes.







Discussion

Reason

The first shift in Danish history marked a significant change in power dynamics, moving away from the dominance of the nobility and clergy toward a centralized monarchy. This transition was driven by various factors such as social, religious, and military changes. At the heart of this shift was the monarch's quest for total control over Danish affairs, aiming to reduce the influence of competing power structures like the nobility and clergy. Motivated by a desire to assert control over Danish affairs, successive monarchs sought to diminish the influence of competing powers, namely the nobility and clergy (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). During the Middle Ages in Denmark, the clergy held significant influence within society, backed by royal privileges and substantial financial resources. Enjoying exemptions from taxes and duties, along with legal immunity in some cases, the clergy wielded authority comparable to the nobility. Their financial bases stemmed from landed estates, urban properties, and tithes, which called for mandatory payments from all members of society. Despite a decline in donations, ecclesiastical institutions retained substantial land holdings with notable entities like the bishopric of Roskilde and Sorø Abbey owning vast estates (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). This economic foundation enabled the clergy not only to fulfill religious duties but also to engage in commercial endeavors, contributing to their multifaceted role as spiritual leaders, landowners, and merchants, solidifying their status as influential figures in medieval Danish society.  Alongside the king, the minuscule elite of noble families, comprising a mere 0.2% of the population, held exclusive rights to agricultural land, the paramount means of production in society  (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Throughout the era, the nobility effectively preserved and extended its political, economic, and social privileges through a system of rights that delineated the boundaries of permissible actions for all estates including the clergy, burghers, and peasantry. These are estates with inherently distinct rights and resources, with a privileged nobility positioned at the zenith. In traditional Danish historiography, the period from 1523 to 1660 is often dubbed the golden age of the nobility, characterized by the zenith of noble power. As such, it was only in subsequent periods that the monarchy could assert independence from the nobility by instituting absolute rule. Furthermore, the nobility and the clergy proved to be obstacles for Danish monarchs at times. They posed an existential threat to ambitious monarchs that wanted to pass reforms that would weaken or diminish their positions. One such example was Christian II's reform laws of 1521–1522 when he tried to reshape Danish society along the lines of the prosperous Netherlands, with measures like the appointment of the skultus to oversee urban governance and the abolition of villeinage (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). However, these reforms stirred discontent among the nobility and clergy, already wary of Christian II's authoritarian rule. His arbitrary executions of nobles without fair trials and his meddling in ecclesiastical affairs, including the controversial appointment of Archbishop Gustav Trolle, further alienated powerful factions. The infamous Stockholm Bloodbath of 1520, orchestrated by Trolle under Christian II's patronage, worsened his reputation across Europe and ignited Swedish rebellion against Danish rule. The subsequent failure to retain control over Sweden, coupled with ongoing conflicts with the Hanseatic towns, eroded Christian II's support base. In 1523, Jutland nobles turned to Duke Frederik of Schleswig as their new king, leading to Christian II's ousting and the end of the Kalmar Union. This historical episode underlines the enduring dominance of the agricultural nobility and clergy, whose control over land and resources remained at large in Danish politics despite attempts at centralization and modernization. As such, the Danish monarchs could not afford to rest and are always wary of the nobility and the clergy in fear of upsetting them. Hence, the monarch’s ambitions for absolute rule propelled efforts to centralize authority within the monarchy, laying the groundwork for a fundamental reconfiguration of Danish governance.

The impact of the Reformation further catalyzed the shift in power from the clergy to the monarchy. However there are some vital events preceding the reformation that contributed to the downfall of the clergy and the power they held. During the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, the Danish church led by powerful archbishops often clashed with the monarchy, asserting its independence and authority. However, by the mid-fourteenth century, tensions between the crown and the church began to ease (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). The death of Archbishop Jacob Kyrning in 1361 highlighted a shift in power dynamics. Although the cathedral chapter in Lund had the right to elect the archbishop, King Valdemar Atterdag intervened, influencing the selection of his preferred candidate, Niels Jonsen. This incident underlined the evolving relationship between the monarchy and the church during the Late Middle Ages. The monarchy's increasing influence over ecclesiastical appointments reflected its growing desire to assert dominance over the church. Several factors contributed to this shift. Among them, the expansion of the Danish monarchy driven by economic and military transformations elevated the king's power over the nobility and other institutions. These converging circumstances enabled the monarchy to realize its ambitions of dominance over the church, marking a significant development in religion and politics. This shift in power dynamics between the monarchy and the church contributed to the broader restructuring of authority and governance in the future. In the year 1517, the advent of Martin Luther's critique of the Catholic church's practices and doctrines challenged the religious authority of the clergy, eroding their traditional role as intermediaries between the divine and the populace (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). The Reformation ushered in an era of religious upheaval and gave way to an environment conducive to the erosion of ecclesiastical influence and the shifts in religious practices and beliefs. Martin Luther's publication of the ninety-five theses in Wittenberg marked the beginning of the division within the old church. Luther's critique of the church's indulgence trade coupled with the outbreak of the German Peasants' War from 1524–1526 fueled an open and radical challenge to the dogmas of the old church. Luther's writings along with those of other reformers spread rapidly across Europe thanks to the printing press. Reformation ideas centered on the notion that the church should not intercede between individuals and God. According to reformers, salvation and grace were solely in God's hands, rendering indulgences, monasticism, pilgrimage, and saint worship as human constructs. Faith, rather than deeds was emphasized, with a call for direct access to God's word through translated Bibles and vernacular sermons. Only sacraments mentioned in the Bible, such as baptism and communion were deemed valid and communion elements were to be available to all believers. Luther also challenged the celibacy requirement for priests and emphasized obedience to secular authorities appointed by God. While Frederik I initially denounced Lutheranism, by 1526, Luther's influence had spread across Jutland  (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). In Haderslev, Frederik I's son Christian imposed the Reformation from above between 1526 and 1528, introducing evangelical services and abolishing celibacy. Urban centers like Viborg and Malmö also saw significant reform. In Viborg, Johannite monk Hans Tausen, influenced by Luther preached according to the Gospels. This lead to the closure of monasteries, adoption of new liturgy, and the marriage of pastors. Danish reformers drew inspiration from Luther and other reformation movements and strived for societal reform guided by biblical principles. From there, Denmark experienced a period of influx of Lutheran values and society as a whole began to tilt towards the favor of it. However, Frederik I died suddenly and the kingdom plunged into a state of unrule, rebellion and infighting until Duke Christian was proclaimed King and became Christian III. The tumultuous years of the Reformation culminated in a Lutheran reformation imposed from above following urban reformations initiated from below. Christian III, having already imposed reform in Haderslev sought to extend Lutheran principles throughout Denmark (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). With his military backing, Christian III imprisoned Catholic bishops signaling his authority over the church. On 30 October 1536, a treaty declared the king as the head of the church, seizing church estates immediately. To solidify Lutheran practices, a Reformation ordinance modeled after Wittenberg's principles was deemed necessary. Christian III corresponded with Luther himself and Johannes Bugenhagen, one of Luther's chief advisers, arrived in Copenhagen to assist. Bugenhagen orchestrated the coronation of the king and queen in the city's main church and collaborated with royal experts, including Peder Palladius, who had studied in Wittenberg, to draft a new church ordinance. The church ordinance issued in Latin in 1537 and translated into Danish in 1539, served as the church's constitution for approximately 150 years and influenced legislation for even longer. By acquiring church properties and assuming responsibility for societal functions like worship, education, and poor relief, the king reduced the church's role in Copenhagen and Danish society while expanded his own power and wealth. This movement marked a significant shift in the relationship between the state and the church where the church lost its traditional privileges and more importantly, its financial income as a result of the confiscation of the church estates. In summary, the church from then on was in no position to challenge the monarch with his or her’s position and power greatly strengthened.

In addition to religious upheaval, Denmark grappled with the profound socio-economic repercussions of plagues and population decline. The devastating toll of plagues, notably the Black Death, precipitated a significant decline in population, disrupting traditional patterns of labor and resource allocation (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). The diminished population weakened the economic and social foundations of the clergy and nobility, whose power rested on the labor and resources of the populace. The era was characterized by a decline in population due to plagues, particularly the Black Death. The plagues of the Late Middle Ages which ravaged Europe and beyond led to significant declines in population density. This demographic shift favored the monarch over the clergy and nobility in Denmark. As the largest landowner in the country, the monarch could recover financially more swiftly compared to smaller landowners who suffered from rent declines and deserted farms. The clergy and nobility, whose tax bases heavily relied on agricultural production suffered more from the population decrease. This led to a power imbalance between the monarch and the two factions and created a favorable environment for the monarch to further weaken the clergy and nobility.

At the same time, military advancements was a part of the shifting dynamics of power within Copenhagen and Danish society. The rise of gunpowder and infantry warfare diminished the military dominance traditionally enjoyed by the nobility and undermined their influence and authority (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Advancements in military tactics during the Late Middle Ages transformed traditional warfare dynamics. These innovations diminished the dominance of heavy cavalry and eroded the military prowess of the nobility. Although the full impact of these changes manifested in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, their seeds were sown earlier. The era's frequent conflicts necessitated larger infantry forces that are often supplemented by foreign mercenaries. Moreover, the construction of stronger fortifications to withstand cannon fire and the upgrade of the navy became imperative. Financing these military investments needed centralized organization with the monarchy emerging as the primary source of funding (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). To meet the financial demands, the monarch imposed taxes on commoners, including burghers and peasants, challenging the traditional feudal order where the nobility and church peasants enjoyed exemptions from ordinary taxation. Furthermore, certain conflicts witnessed significant conscription of commoners that represented a departure from past practices. As centralized military forces became increasingly pivotal in defending Danish sovereignty, the monarch sought to consolidate authority over military affairs, further consolidating power within the kingdom. Consequently, military developments during this period centralized power and resources around the monarchy, reshaped the socio-political landscape and challenged established feudal structures, especially the nobility in Copenhagen and Denmark. 

Ultimately, the Swedish invasion of Denmark in 1658 served as a catalyst for the consolidation of monarchical authority. The invasion which posed a significant threat to Danish sovereignty exposed the vulnerability of the Danish state and highlighted the imperative of centralized authority capable of repelling external threats. As the Duke of Holstein, the King grappled with significant challenges stemming from the intricate history of the region (Langen & Stjernfelt, 2022). Generations ago, the duchy of Sleswick-Holstein had undergone division among various inheritance lines, resulting in crucial portions of Holstein falling outside Danish sovereignty and instead coming under the jurisdiction of the Duke of Gottorp, who resided in Kiel. Through intermarriages, some of these territories had become subject to the control of the Russian Czar. A third portion of Holstein was jointly ruled by the Danish King and the Duke of Gottorp, further complicating the territorial landscape with disjointed fragments. Historically, this division had posed considerable problems for the Danish government as the Duke of Gottorp retained the freedom to forge alliances with foreign powers including Denmark's arch-enemy, Sweden. Denmark faced a near existential threat in 1658 when the Swedish army that was advancing from Holstein crossed the frozen Belts from the west and seized control of all of Zealand except for the fortified Copenhagen, which King Frederick III fiercely defended (Langen & Stjernfelt, 2022). The humiliating Peace at Roskilde in the same year resulted in Denmark losing its ancient territories east of the Oresund strait including the provinces of Scania, Halland and Blekinge with the exception of the island of Bornholm. Despite subsequent efforts to reclaim lost territories, notably during the Great Northern War in the early eighteenth century, hostilities persisted between Denmark-Norway and Sweden-Finland well into the latter half of the century. In response, King Frederick III capitalized on the turmoil to establish absolutism and marked the beginning of a century characterized by authoritarian rule in Denmark-Norway. This era of absolutism, described vividly in English diplomat Robert Molesworth's renowned Account of Denmark published in 1694, endured until the ascension of the youthful Christian VII to the throne in 1766.

In summary, the first shift in power in Danish history represents a multifaceted transformation shaped by a convergence of socio-political, religious, and military factors. Driven by the monarch's quest for absolute authority, the impact of the Reformation, demographic changes brought about by plagues, advancements in military technology and external threats posed by the Swedish invasion, this transition reshaped the power dynamics of the Copenhagen and Danish society and laid the foundation for the establishment of absolute monarchy and the centralization of authority within the kingdom.

Effect

The era of absolute rule in Denmark, initiated in 1660, marked a pivotal shift in the country's political landscape, reverberating throughout Copenhagen and impacting its inhabitants across various spheres of life. At the core of this transformation was the centralization of power under the monarchy, a process facilitated by the dissolution of traditional governing bodies like the council of the realm and the introduction of legislative measures that vested unchecked authority in the king (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Frederik III's assumption of absolute authority in October 1660 signified a monumental transformation in Danish governance. By dismantling the council of the realm and disregarding traditional coronation protocols, Frederik III consolidated his power and rendered his authority unquestionable. The enactment of the Sovereignty Act in January 1661 further cemented the monarchy's hereditary nature and vested the monarch with immense legislative, executive, and ecclesiastical powers. Previously, monarchs were elected by the nobility in the council of the realm and were required to sign coronation charters, but now the throne became hereditary, marking a shift towards centralized authority. Absolute rule gradually solidified throughout the period, leading to the establishment of a centralized state that diminished the power of the nobility by the period's end (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). This era witnessed a paradigm shift in the perception of nobility, moving away from lineage-based criteria towards recognition based on wealth and service to the crown . Monarchs like Christian V and Frederik IV exercised personal dominion, relying heavily on close advisors for governance. Conversely, rulers such as Christian VI prioritized religious principles, while Frederik V delegated substantial authority to his ministers as a way to foster stability to counter the challenges to royal supremacy. For the clergy, the subsequent promulgation of the King’s Code in 1665 broadened the legal framework, endowing the king with unrestrained control over state affairs while reinforcing the monarchy's religious prerogatives. In essence, Frederik III's era redefined the landscape of Copenhagen and Danish governance, elevating the monarchy to unparalleled heights of power. It recalibrated the dynamics of nobility and governance and ushered in an era of stability while unveiling the inherent risks of absolute authority.

To accomplish all this, the absolute monarchs relied heavily on a well-structured administration, prompting a reorganization of the royal administrative system after 1660 to accommodate the expanding state responsibilities. A centralized hierarchy of public offices was established with the monarch positioned at its apex while efforts to professionalize civil service gradually gained traction. The early absolutist kings recognized the necessity of diversifying the social composition of the administration to cultivate loyal civil servants capable of bolstering state power (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Consequently, they recruited civil servants from burgher backgrounds, deviating from the nobility's historical monopoly over state offices. Some civil servants had theological education from the University of Copenhagen, while others acquired training abroad or from existing government officials. In 1736, the University of Copenhagen introduced a law degree, making formal legal qualifications imperative for various royal offices. Law graduates from the university gradually assumed roles in central and local administration. Additionally, a minor law exam became available after practical training with a royal official. By the early nineteenth century, most central and local administrative posts were occupied by individuals with formal legal backgrounds, although instances of corruption and abuse persisted. Initially servants to the king, civil servants evolved into custodians of state and societal interests by the late eighteenth century, with many endorsing the transition toward enlightened or opinion-guided absolutism (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). During the mid-eighteenth century, the concept of enlightened absolutism emerged as the prevailing political ideology for the monarchy. Influenced by Enlightenment principles, the government embarked on groundbreaking reforms aimed at modernizing rural society and enhancing various aspects of public welfare, including poor relief, education, and healthcare. Economically, Denmark faced challenges, experiencing near-collapse in 1660 and 1814. However between these periods, the country enjoyed periods of growth and prosperity. This centralization extended beyond the political realm, permeating into legal systems, governance structures and societal norms and fundamentally changed the dynamics of power and authority in Copenhagen. The central administration, headquartered in the capital, encompassed military and non-military segments (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Key institutions included the Danish and German chancelleries, responsible for legal matters, foreign policy and Schleswig-Holstein affairs, the treasury overseeing state finances and the war chancellery managing the army and navy. Regionally, districts replaced local districts in 1662, accompanied by the appointment of district stewards and prefects by the king. These districts assumed responsibility for legal matters, ecclesiastical cases, civil servant supervision, and infrastructure upkeep. The establishment of the Supreme Court in 1661 marked a significant addition to the judicial system that supplants the king’s final appeal court. While the king was technically the court's head, judges wielded practical judicial authority from the late seventeenth century onwards. The judicial system also featured specialized courts and temporary commission courts, documenting proceedings in meticulous records (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). To establish a standardized legal framework, provincial laws were replaced by the Danish Code of 1683 and the Norwegian Code of 1687. These laws that were supplemented by subsequent legislation facilitated the administration's reliance on the rule of law promoted equitable treatment of all subjects and humane penal provisions. In the 1680s, standardization efforts extended to weights, measures, and taxation, enhancing administrative efficiency and control (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Ole Rømer's contributions were instrumental in streamlining measurement systems that were to be followed by the people, while comprehensive land surveys and valuation facilitated more efficient tax collection. These reforms represented significant milestones in the evolution of Copenhagen and of the early absolutist regime, fostering administrative standardization and professionalization while steering the Copenhagen inhabitants towards a more regulated society. 

For the citizens of Copenhagen, it would appear that there were major changes in the surroundings of Copenhagen during absolute rule with impressive structures like Christiansborg Palace and Frederiksstaden being constructed. These buildings played the role of demonstrating the monarchy’s greatness and control over the country as they attract ordinary Copenhagen citizens with their magnificent scale and structure. Copenhagen Castle, the former main residence of the king during the era of absolute rule possessed an outdated medieval structure that failed to symbolize the authority of the absolute monarch (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Recognizing the need for modernization, Frederik IV initiated a comprehensive reconstruction of Copenhagen Castle, which involved adding a new archive building and the Red Building for central administration. When Christian VI became king, Copenhagen Castle was demolished to make space for Christiansborg Palace. Completed in 1740 and fully adorned over the next decade, the palace featured private chambers for the king and queen, along with quarters for courtiers organized by estate and rank, mirroring European models. The close proximity of the king's living quarters, administrative offices, and social spaces underlined the intimate connection between the monarchy and the state. After its completion, Christiansborg Palace accommodated over eight hundred individuals, with additional court affiliates residing in the Prince’s Mansion or elsewhere in Copenhagen. Despite a devastating fire in 1794, Christiansborg Palace was rebuilt and restored by 1828. Meanwhile, Frederik V's legacy in Denmark included the development of Frederiksstaden, a new district characterized by wide streets and grand mansions (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). At its center was an octagonal courtyard featuring an equestrian statue of Frederik V sculpted by Jacques-François-Joseph Saly. Constructed in 1748, the district comprised four palaces, each built by different members of the nobility who gave their names to the structures. Following the fire at Christiansborg Palace, two of these palaces became permanent residences for the royal family, establishing Amalienborg as a distinguished royal residence. For the citizens that lived in Copenhagen, the impressive structures erected during absolute rule symbolized the monarchy's power and grandeur. Buildings like Christiansborg Palace served as visual representations of the monarch's authority, drawing awe and admiration from ordinary citizens who witnessed the city's transformation. The scale and magnificence of these edifices would have inspired a sense of pride and loyalty among Copenhagen’s inhabitants, reinforcing their connection to the monarchy and the state.

Although absolute rule brought periods of peace and wealth, it also had tough times. Losing Norway to Sweden in 1814 and facing bankruptcy showed how weak the absolute system could be during crises. Kings like Christian VII, who had mental problems caused fights and uncertainty in the royal court, making things unstable (Langen & Stjernfelt, 2022). The reign of Christian VII that was marred by his mental afflictions exposed the inherent vulnerabilities of absolute rule, particularly regarding issues of succession and regency. This period underlined the fragility of a system concentrated in the hands of a single individual, exposing the complexities and pitfalls of centralized authority. In the intricate political landscape of Denmark during the late 18th century, the young German physician Johann Friedrich Struensee found himself thrust into a rapid ascent to power that commenced in 1768 (Langen & Stjernfelt, 2022). In a rush, the court arranged a marriage in 1766 between the young King and Princess Caroline Matilda, in hopes to ease his restlessness and strengthen ties with England. Despite the union's creation of a male heir, Crown Prince Frederik, genuine affection did not develop between the teenage couple. The King's discontent persisted, leading to his involvement with a notorious prostitute named Støvlet-Katrine by 1767. Their late-night escapades in Copenhagen, frequenting brothels and engaging in revelry, spread to the public and revealed the King's increasingly erratic behavior that were marked by paranoid delusions and fits of rage. To address these issues, the State Council exiled Støvlet-Katrine to Holstein and reluctantly supported the King's ambitious international tour as a distraction. During this journey across North Germany, Holland, England, and France, a young and talented doctor named Johann Friedrich Struensee was tasked with monitoring the King's mental well-being. Struensee's background that was rooted in pietism and Enlightenment ideals shaped his future trajectory. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, he pursued medicine and settled in Altona where he built a network of intellectuals and socialites. His experiences there acquainted him with Danish censorship nuances and medical community power dynamics. Struensee's reputation as a physician caught the attention of Count Rantzau, who recommended him to the Danish court for the King's treatment. Establishing a close bond with the King, Struensee eventually became his personal physician and earning favor at court. (Langen & Stjernfelt, 2022). In a dramatic twist of fate, Struensee also became intimately involved with Queen Matilda, neglected by her husband. Their affair resulted in the birth of Louise Augusta in 1771. Seizing the opportunity presented by his proximity to both the King and Queen, Struensee ascended to power in September 1770, enacting a flurry of legislative reforms that left an indelible mark on Danish history. Hence, in the period of time that Struensee was in power, the state was effectively ruled by him and not the monarch, which resulted in the enaction of incredibly bold policies that occur in the reign of Christian VII. Fortunately for Copenhagen and its inhabitants, this period did not end in any wars even though the situation in politics were chaotic for Struensee, Christian VII and other factions.

Following up on Struensee and his reforms, it was observed that in the area of press freedom, Struensee’s actions proved to be groundbreaking and have lasting impact on the field. Prior to the advent of Press Freedom, the framework for the printed public was governed by the provisions of King Christian V's Danish Law of 1683 (Langen & Stjernfelt, 2022). Essentially, all publications required prior approval from the leading professors in the Academic Council of the University of Copenhagen before printers and booksellers could circulate them in the market. Breaches of these regulations incurred severe penalties. Censors were particularly vigilant regarding discussions on religious and political matters, as well as the dissemination of lampoons and defamatory writings, especially against the court, the King, or foreign powers. Despite the strict legislative measures, gaps in censorship persisted in practice. Scholars could readily access uncensored foreign publications, while numerous small prints clandestinely made their way into the market without undergoing scrutiny by the censors. The 14 September Press Freedom Ordinance marked a pivotal moment in absolutist Denmark, heralding a significant shift in power dynamics. Struensee, the personal physician of King Christian VII, wielded unprecedented political authority during a brief yet intense 16-month period following the ordinance's enactment. Struensee's tenure saw the rapid introduction of radical enlightenment-inspired legislations, reshaping the socio-political landscape. 

“We are fully convinced that it is as harmful to the impartial search for truth as it is to the discovery of obsolete errors and prejudices, if upright patriots, zealous for the common good and
what is genuinely best for their fellow citizens, because they are frightened by reputation, orders, and preconceived opinions, are hindered from being free to write according to their insight, conscience, and conviction, attacking abuses and uncovering prejudices. And thus in
this regard, after ripe consideration, we have decided to permit in our kingdoms and lands in
general an unlimited freedom of the press of such a form, that from now on no one shall be
required and obliged to submit books and writings that he wants to bring to the press to the
previously required censorship and approval, and thus to submit them to the control of those

German Cabinet Order in Nyerup (ed.) 1791, 1–2; also in Hansen 1916, I, 46–47 (Langen & Stjernfelt, 2022). The intricate provisions within the Ordinance stood in stark contrast to the King's own resolute and straightforward manner of expression. The Ordinance sought to justify the decision and elucidate the rationale behind the King's aspiration to institute press freedom. The language employed in specific clauses of the Ordinance embodied an Enlightenment agenda reflective of the radical ideologies prevalent during the era. Fundamentally, the Ordinance espoused the concept of a well-ordered public sphere, wherein truth could be sought through impartial inquiry: "The impartial search for truth." This quest for truth was entrusted to upright patriots guided by their insight, conscience, and conviction. The underlying objective was to embrace Enlightenment principles to eradicate obsolete errors and prejudices by challenging abuses and exposing prejudices. Implicitly, the Ordinance delineated the envisioned constituents of the public sphere and outlined its intended purpose. However, the Ordinance remained vague regarding the practical mechanisms of communication within this envisioned public sphere. It did not anticipate the divergent interpretations of what constituted errors, abuses, and prejudices, which could potentially lead to discord. However, a coup on 17 January 1772 abruptly ended Struensee's ascendancy, culminating in his public execution on 28 April of the same year (Langen & Stjernfelt, 2022). Despite his downfall, Press Freedom, catalyzed by a surge of pamphlets and debates in 1771, persisted in the aftermath of the coup. Nonetheless, the post-Struensee government, wary of the destabilizing effects of unrestricted press, gradually curtailed this newfound freedom through incremental interventions between 1772 and 1773. Despite these measures, pre-print censorship was never reinstated, signifying a fundamental shift in Denmark's media landscape. The Press Freedom Period emerged as a large-scale adventurous experiment, pondering the consequences of a mid-size European absolutist state abruptly abolishing all censorship (Langen & Stjernfelt, 2022). Bolle Willum Luxdorph, a civil servant, meticulously chronicled this experiment through a vast collection of nearly 1,000 writings, encompassing almost every new publication following the advent of Press Freedom until its termination in 1773. Luxdorph's collection, titled "Writings of The Press Freedom," arranged these publications thematically across 47 volumes, providing an unparalleled insight into the development of Press Freedom on a day-to-day basis. This book delves into the repercussions of the Press Freedom experiment, drawing primarily from the Luxdorph Collection. The term "Press Freedom Writings" denotes publications within the collection, along with nearly 200 related works discovered elsewhere. While some publications have been sporadically referenced for various purposes, many deemed them unworthy of serious study for years. Critics, including historian Carl Bruun and Edvard Holm, deplored the excesses of the Press Freedom Period, labeling it as a Walpurgis Night of rudeness, stupidity, and meanness. Holm, in particular, dismissed several writings for their lack of quality and taste, highlighting their thematic and stylistic inconsistencies (Langen & Stjernfelt, 2022). In brief, press Freedom started in 1770, breaking old rules and giving people the chance to freely talk and write about ideas. This freedom led to lots of discussions and new thoughts, making Danish society more vibrant. Even though some tried to limit press freedom later on, its impact stayed and shaped how media worked and how the people in Copenhagen saw themselves as a country.

In summary, the era of absolute rule in Denmark left an indelible mark on Copenhagen and its inhabitants, reshaping political, architectural, and societal landscapes in profound and enduring ways. From the centralization of power under the monarchy to the construction of grandiose architectural landmarks, from periods of prosperity to challenges of instability, and from the pursuit of intellectual freedom to the constraints of royal authority, the era of absolute rule in Denmark encapsulated a complex tapestry of change and continuity that continues to resonate in the collective memory of the citizens of Copenhagen.

Reason

The second shift in Danish governance and society, following the loss of Norway to Sweden in 1814, was driven by national conflicts, economic challenges, and shifting foreign policies. This period saw significant changes that affected Copenhagen and its inhabitants in various ways. In 1814, Denmark suffered a significant setback in the Napoleonic Wars, resulting in the loss of Norway to Sweden (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). With the loss of Norway in 1814 and the state's financial struggles, Denmark found itself reduced to a small, poor country by the mid-nineteenth century. This marked the end of the era of absolute rule and set the stage for further political and social transformations in Denmark's history. Forced to cede Norway to Sweden, Denmark's weakened state faced economic ruin and loss of military power due to the Napoleonic Wars and the earlier loss of its fleet in 1807. At the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815, major powers determined state borders without Danish input, resulting in Holstein's membership in the German Confederation, blurring lines between Danish domestic and foreign policy (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.) It was under these backgrounds that the national movements emerged, particularly in Schleswig-Holstein and Denmark. The Danish national movement, centered in Copenhagen, sought to extend Denmark's territory to the River Eider, while the Schleswig-Holstein movement advocated for regional autonomy aligned with the German Confederation. In fact, the political landscape of 19th-century Denmark and the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein was shaped by the emergence of national movements and the transition from absolutism to constitutional monarchy. The formation of political spheres fueled by the rise of national consciousness paved the way for significant developments in governance and identity. The introduction of advisory assemblies of the estates in 1831 marked a pivotal moment in the politicization process  (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). While these assemblies fostered a political public sphere for societal discourse, censorship laws imposed by the absolutist regime limited the scope of discussion. Nevertheless, a liberal opposition primarily organized through single-issue or civic educational associations began to challenge the status quo. The estate assemblies established as a response to external pressures following the revolutionary wave of 1830 aimed to mollify liberal forces and prevent the rise of a formidable opposition. However, these assemblies inadvertently provided a platform for Danish and Schleswig-Holstein national movements that ultimately undermine the absolute monarchy and the composite state  (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). The Schleswig-Holstein movement, initially advocating for an independent yet connected Schleswig-Holstein within the composite state gained momentum after 1831. Rooted in the urban middle class and fueled by desires for a free constitution, this movement sought to preserve regional autonomy while aligning with the German Confederation. Conversely, the Danish national movement centered in Copenhagen championed the idea of extending Denmark to the River Eider. Led by National Liberals and fueled by influential newspapers like Fædrelandet, this movement articulated a vision of a unified Danish nation-state encompassing Denmark and Schleswig. The absolutist government however, caught between the polarizing demands of the national movements grappled with maintaining stability while addressing growing discontent. Attempts to reconcile opposing factions proved futile as polarization intensified particularly after 1840 when language became a political and national marker. The revolutions of 1848 resulted in political upheaval across Europe prompting calls for constitutional reforms and national self-determination. In Denmark, the ascendancy of Frederik VII and the formation of the March Ministry underlined the shift towards constitutional governance  (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Simultaneously, the Schleswig-Holstein rebellion, fueled by aspirations for German unification and freedom challenged Danish authority in the duchies. The provisional government in Schleswig-Holstein legitimized by perceived hostility from Copenhagen mobilized civilian militias and seized military installations, exacerbating tensions within the composite state. Despite internal divisions and external pressures, Denmark and the duchies navigated a period of profound political transformation, marked by the erosion of absolutism, the assertion of national identities, and the pursuit of constitutional governance. These national conflicts, exacerbated by external pressures and internal divisions, culminated in the First Schleswig War and subsequent loss of territory to Prussia and Austria. Copenhagen and its inhabitants experienced the repercussions of these conflicts firsthand, with the city serving as a political and cultural hub during this tumultuous period. The First Schleswig War or the Three Years’ War from 1848-1500 exemplified Denmark's internal strife (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Danish National Liberals sought a nation state encompassing Denmark and Schleswig while Schleswig-Holstein's movement aimed for independence. The conflict escalated with Denmark initially prevailing until Prussia and the German Confederation intervened, compelling Denmark into a defensive position. The war's decisive phase occurred at the Battle of Isted in 1850 that lead to Schleswig-Holstein's surrender under pressure from Prussia and Austria. Despite significant casualties, Denmark retained its composite state, albeit with tensions between its constituent parts. In the process, the King of Denmark, Frederik VII decided that absolute rule was not the adequate way to rule over Denmark anymore. Upon the appointment of the March Ministry, Frederik VII made a pivotal declaration asserting himself as a constitutional monarch without absolute power. This declaration marked the beginning of efforts towards establishing a free constitution in Denmark and the introduction of a new constitution in 1848 heralded a shift towards democratic governance, with the establishment of a bicameral parliament and the extension of voting rights to a segment of the population. The political landscape evolved further with the emergence of political parties like Venstre and Højre, reflecting diverse ideologies and agendas shared by the inhabitants of Copenhagen and Denmark.

Effect

At the heart of the declaration by Frederik VII was the introduction of a new constitution, marking a departure from absolute rule and paving the way for constitutional monarchy. The transition from absolutism to constitutional governance was not sudden but evolved gradually, with key events such as the Treaty of Kiel in 1814 and the Three Years’ War from 1848 to 1850 shaping Copenhagen and Denmark's political landscape. Elections for a national constituent assembly were promptly called, extending the right to vote to respectable men over thirty with their own households (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). The assembly elected in October 1848 amidst the ongoing war, comprised of three major factions: the Friends of the Peasants, conservatives, and National Liberals. Each faction represented distinct political ideologies and agendas, reflecting the diverse aspirations within Danish society during this tumultuous period. The Friends of the Peasants emerged as a potent political force advocating for democracy, suffrage for all men over twenty-five and a reduced role for the king in decision-making processes. They championed a one-chamber parliament, reflecting their commitment to broad-based democratic principles. Conversely, conservatives, led by figures like A.S. Ørsted, sought to preserve elements of the absolutist state while recognizing the inevitability of constitutional reforms. Meanwhile, the National Liberals that were positioned as the governing group assumed leadership roles in negotiating the draft constitution, envisioning a political framework inspired by models such as the Belgian and Norwegian constitutions. The draft constitution authored by D.G. Monrad and revised by Orla Lehmann advocated for a bicameral parliament consisting of Landsting (Higher House) and Folketing (Lower House) (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). The Landsting served as a conservative check against potential majority rule in the Folketing. However, voting rights were extended cautiously, primarily to middle-aged men from upper classes, aiming to prevent hasty decisions driven by uninformed majorities. The June Constitution of 1849 formalized these arrangements, granting limited suffrage to a segment of the population, excluding women and lower social strata. Post-1848, Danish politics witnessed significant transformations, marked by the emergence of political parties like Venstre, Højre, and the Social Democrats. The constitutional struggle between the Folketing and Landsting, spanning from 1875 to 1901, underlined the evolving power dynamics within Danish governance. Meanwhile, the introduction of social legislation in the early 1890s aimed to address economic inequalities and improve living conditions, reflecting a growing awareness of social welfare concerns. The ascension of the first Venstre government in 1901 represented a paradigm shift in Danish politics, symbolizing the acceptance of parliamentarianism as a governing principle. These developments represented Denmark's journey towards a more inclusive and democratic society that undoubtedly benefited the citizens of Copenhagen as more and more groups could now represent themselves politically. The introduction of the new constitution also established a limited monarchy where the king shared his once absolute power with a parliament elected by universal male suffrage, with women gaining voting rights in 1915  (Jespersen, 2018). The Parliament, consisting of two chambers, the Landsting and the Folketing, had the Landsting serving as a conservative counterbalance to the legislative process, its members chosen based on more conservative principles than those of the Folketing, the Lower House. While the constitution curtailed much of the king's authority, he retained executive power and the freedom to appoint ministers, albeit with ministerial decisions requiring parliamentary approval, marking a shift from royal autocracy to ministerial responsibility to Parliament. The Danish constitution adhered closely to Montesquieu's doctrine of separation of powers, echoing principles found in the American constitution and other democratic systems like Belgium's in 1831  (Jespersen, 2018). This ensured a balance of power among the executive headed by the king, the legislature headed by the parliament, and the judiciary headed by the courts, with the judiciary enjoying considerable independence to maintain checks and balances among the branches of government. Denmark's constitution stood out for its democratic features, especially regarding the breadth of suffrage, attributed in part to the implementation of universal male military service aimed at bolstering the army during wartime. Universal military service became a constitutional obligation, reflecting Denmark's commitment to ensuring a well-prepared military force  (Jespersen, 2018). In the constitution, universal male suffrage seemed to be a reciprocal arrangement: citizens were obliged to defend their country, so granting them political influence seemed reasonable. However, after the war, political elites lamented giving rural populations, perceived as uneducated peasants, political responsibility they believed they couldn't handle. National Liberal figure Orla Lehmann epitomized this elitist view, advocating for power to reside only with the educated and wealthy elite, not the common folk (Jespersen, 2018). This led to a political struggle between those aiming to limit democracy and rural groups seeking more political sway alongside the economic freedom gained through agrarian reforms. While it might seem that the shift from absolutism to democracy was revolutionary and marked a clear break from the past, it was more nuanced. The absolute monarchy had long portrayed itself as the interpreter of popular will, evolving into the highest expression of people's will by the late eighteenth century. The 1849 constitution introduced Parliament as a formal outlet for people's will, limiting the king's interpretation. Yet, the basis of state power's legitimacy, the will of the people, remained unchanged, albeit through different institutional forms. This continuity likely explains why the transition, termed a revolution, was smooth and not perceived as a stark break, even by the king, who willingly relinquished absolute power and earned popularity as the provider of the constitution, earning the moniker "Frederik the Beloved." (Jespersen, 2018). Democratic forces had a historical presence in Danish society, emerging in response to the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, like in other parts of Europe. Initially, in the early 19th century, liberal and nationalist movements operated independently, with liberal circles lacking nationalism and nationalists being staunch conservatives. Until around 1830, the regime effectively controlled both movements due to their divergence. After 1830, following revolutionary events in France, the regime began conceding to liberal demands by convening advisory assemblies in key provinces, starting in 1834. Despite attempts to control them, these assemblies became hubs for opposition voices, laying the groundwork for a middle-class public, a crucial step towards democracy (Jespersen, 2018). This marked the beginning of a trend that couldn't be halted, despite the regime's efforts during the last years of absolutism. The shift accelerated in the 1840s as the once internationally oriented liberal movement turned national, influenced by rising tensions between Danes and Germans in the duchies. The influential liberal middle class increasingly embraced nationalism, forming a dynamic National Liberal movement with a critical national agenda, becoming the focal point for both liberals and nationalists. This unity of ideologies spelled the end for absolutism, sealing its fate by around 1840, culminating in its demise in 1848. In essence, while events may have appeared disjointed, there was a significant underlying continuity shaping the course of Danish political evolution. A significant shift occurred in 1848, yet many changes formalized in the new constitution had been evolving gradually over time (Jespersen, 2018). Despite the shift, numerous absolutist traditions persisted largely intact. Much of the Danish Law of 1683 remained in effect, with some provisions still relevant today. While department names changed to ministries and their heads became ministers accountable to Parliament, the core of the central administration remained structurally and procedurally similar to absolutist times. This continuity is evident in modern Danish government practices. Similar to absolutism, civil servants maintain an ethos of impartiality and non-political allegiance to the government, akin to their loyalty to the king in the past (Jesperson, 2018). This enduring mindset that was prevalent across all levels of public service contributes to the stability and continuity of the central administration, even amid political transitions. In such sense, he leaders of the National Liberals in 1848 were not radical disruptors but rather pragmatic individuals seeking influence within the system. After achieving their goals, they maintained the status quo with the same diligence as the absolutist kings, shunning social upheaval. Hence, while the events of 1848 appeared revolutionary on the surface, they merely set new political agendas and established the framework for a middle-class nation-state. Beneath the surface, some aspects of the enduring structures of absolutism appears unchanged for the citizens of Copenhagen and Denmark. 

Economically, Copenhagen experienced a liberalization of trade policies, marked by the cancellation of special rights and the promotion of economic freedom. The government's focus on education and infrastructure development contributed to economic growth and social progress in the city. After 1814, the absolute rule stopped trying to control trade and industry (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). This happened because people had the right to own property, even in rural areas, which meant land could be freely traded. From the 1830s, there was a more liberal approach that focused on dividing work, promoting competition, and encouraging a market-based economy. At the same time, the government was careful not to interfere too much with the rights of city merchants. They kept the market towns and craft guilds in charge of trade, even though craftsmen sometimes started businesses outside these towns, which was against the rules but seen as good for farming. When absolutism ended in 1848–1849, the liberal government was not invested to the merchants' and guilds' special rights and got rid of these privileges with the Freedom of Trade Act in 1857, which was a major victory for economic freedom (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). The government mostly stayed out of regulating business and industry. They helped economic growth by focusing on education and improving infrastructure. To summarize, the shift towards liberalism and the removal of merchant and guild privileges were key aspects of Denmark's changing economic policy during this period of transition from absolute rule to a more democratic governance structure.

Changes in foreign policies, driven by geopolitical realities and strategic considerations, shaped Denmark's approach to diplomacy and defense. The shift towards neutrality, particularly after the loss of northern Schleswig to Germany, influenced Copenhagen's role as a neutral capital in Europe. The November Constitution of 1863 precipitated war with Prussia and Austria in 1864 (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Denmark, outnumbered and facing defeat, ceded Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg, effectively becoming a nation-state and losing a substantial portion of its territory and population. Right after the war, Danish politics were a mix of fear of destruction and hope for recovery. People hoped that northern Schleswig would reunite with Denmark after a great European war, which seemed likely in 1866 when Prussia and Austria fought (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). Denmark even offered Prussia an alliance for northern Schleswig but it was rejected. At peace talks in 1864, France suggested that northern Schleswig's border could change after a referendum, raising Danish hopes. However, when Prussia and France clashed in 1870, Denmark hesitated to ally with France and eventually forfeited. France's defeat in 1871 led to a united Germany under Prussian control, becoming the dominant force in Europe. Danish hopes for recovery faded gradually and by 1870, northern Schleswig's fate was mainly between Denmark and Germany. With Germany's rising power, Denmark lost hope for major power support. Denmark couldn't do much when Bismarck canceled Section 5 of the 1864 treaty in 1879 (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). After 1870, Denmark chose neutrality to avoid major power conflicts and survive. From 1879 to 1901, Højre's government focused on making Denmark militarily resilient for defensive purposes. They built fortifications around Copenhagen and prepared to hold off attacks until help arrived. This defensive strategy was popular because it was economically feasible and seen as effective for a neutral state. In contrast, Venstre's policy from 1901 to 1914 was less about fortifications and more about diplomacy (Aarhus Universitet, n.d.). They hoped for Germany to return northern Schleswig voluntarily. By 1909, Denmark improved its defenses, but mainly towards the sea, signaling a shift towards Germany in foreign policy. Despite this, Denmark's neutrality during World War I wasn't due to its German-leaning policy but because it wasn't strategically important to the warring parties. 

In essence, the second shift in Danish governance and society brought about significant changes in Copenhagen and its inhabitants' lives. From political reforms to economic liberalization and shifts in foreign policies, the city became a dynamic center of political, economic, and cultural activity amidst a period of profound transformation in Denmark's history.

Conclusion

The shifts in power within Danish history, from the ascendancy of the monarchy over the nobility and clergy to the subsequent transition towards constitutional monarchy, represent pivotal moments that shaped Copenhagen and Danish society in profound ways. The evolution from a decentralized feudal system to an absolute monarchy was driven by various factors, including the monarchs' ambitions for centralized authority, socio-economic changes such as the impact of the Reformation and population decline due to plagues, and advancements in military technology. These dynamics gradually weakened the traditional power structures of the nobility and clergy, paving the way for the establishment of absolute rule by monarchs like Frederick III. The era of absolute rule in Denmark, starting from 1660, transformed Copenhagen and its inhabitants profoundly. Initiated by Frederik III's assumption of absolute authority, it centralized power under the monarchy, leading to the dissolution of traditional governing bodies and the establishment of unchecked royal authority. The Sovereignty Act of 1661 solidified the monarchy's hereditary nature and concentrated legislative, executive, and ecclesiastical powers in the hands of the king. This period saw a shift in the perception of nobility, prioritizing wealth and service to the crown over lineage-based criteria. To support absolute rule, a well-structured administration was established, recruiting civil servants from non-noble backgrounds and emphasizing formal legal qualifications. The concept of enlightened absolutism emerged during the mid-eighteenth century, focusing on modernizing society and enhancing public welfare. Architecturally, Copenhagen underwent significant changes, with impressive structures like Christiansborg Palace and Frederiksstaden constructed to showcase the monarchy's power and control. Despite periods of peace and prosperity, absolute rule faced challenges such as the loss of Norway to Sweden in 1814 and economic difficulties. The reign of Christian VII and the rise of Johann Friedrich Struensee highlighted the vulnerabilities of absolute rule, leading to significant reforms including groundbreaking press freedom ordinances. Struensee's brief but influential tenure saw the introduction of radical enlightenment-inspired legislation, reshaping Copenhagen and Denmark's socio-political landscape. 
 
The transition to constitutional monarchy in the 19th century marked another significant shift, driven by internal and external pressures, including the loss of Norway to Sweden and the rise of liberal and nationalist movements influenced by events like the French Revolution. The First Schleswig War and the declaration by Frederik VII marked a pivotal shift in Danish governance from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy, introducing a new constitution that gradually evolved through key events like the Treaty of Kiel in 1814 and the Three Years’ War from 1848 to 1850. This transition saw the emergence of political factions such as the Friends of the Peasants, conservatives, and National Liberals, each advocating for distinct ideologies and agendas. The resulting constitution of 1849 established a bicameral parliament and limited suffrage, laying the foundation for Denmark's democratic evolution. Economically, Copenhagen experienced liberalization with the removal of merchant and guild privileges, fostering economic growth through education and infrastructure development. Foreign policy changes, driven by geopolitical realities, led Denmark towards neutrality after the loss of northern Schleswig to Germany, culminating in the November Constitution of 1863 and subsequent conflicts. Despite setbacks like the loss of territory and population to Germany, Danish politics was split between hope for recovery and pragmatic strategies for survival. The period from 1879 to 1901 saw a focus on military resilience, while later policies prioritized diplomacy. To summarize, Denmark's journey towards constitutional governance brought about expanded political rights, the establishment of democratic institutions, and a shift towards liberal economic policies. These changes culminated in the emergence of political parties and a more diplomatic foreign policy approach.

Throughout these shifts, Copenhagen remained a focal point of political activity and societal change, serving as a hub for intellectual discourse, activism, and governance. The city and its inhabitants played a crucial role in shaping Denmark's political evolution, adapting to turbulent times and embracing democratic principles. In essence, the shifts in power within Danish history reflect the resilience and adaptability of Copenhagen and Danish society. The legacy of these transitions continues to influence Danish identity and governance, underlining the importance of historical context in understanding the dynamics of power and authority.
